- We have a unique app name: myCoverage.
- While we referenced the RecyclerViewDemo we both built upon and adjusted the code to fit the needs of our term app.
- We initialized 20 "Trips" when the app is opened.
- The yellow floating button, allows users to create a new trip.
- For the widgets, we used a combination of TextViews and Buttons.
- The user can delete the "Trips" by sliding to the left (when deleting the automatically created "Trips", it looks like they are not being deleted because of how quickly the app scrolls up, but if enough of them are deleted, there is a visible difference.
